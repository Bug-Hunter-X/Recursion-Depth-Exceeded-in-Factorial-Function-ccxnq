# Recursion Depth Exceeded in Factorial Function

This repository demonstrates a common Python error: exceeding the maximum recursion depth. The `factorial_bug.py` file contains a recursive factorial function that works for small numbers but fails for larger ones due to exceeding Python's default recursion limit.

The `factorial_solution.py` file provides a corrected version using iteration, which avoids the recursion depth issue and is more efficient for larger inputs.
